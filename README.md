# [Bun.sh] + Fable

This is a small repository that adds [Fable] bindings for [Bun.sh], these are very minimal and only add a few convenience methods for Bun's request/response impl consumption, but the rest of the Bun API should be included eventually, feel free to contribute any bindings that are missing for you!
