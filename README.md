# [Bun.sh] + Fable Playground

This is a small and experimental repo to add a few bindings for the node.js new competitor runtime [bun.sh]

Although this is not something serious yet, if you actually want to work with me to make this a true bindings project let me know!
I'd be glad to work towards something like that

# Requirements

- .NET6 and above - https://get.dot.net
- Bun - [bun.sh]

# Try the sample

After installing .NET + Bun just run

`bun start` on your terminal and it should just work
