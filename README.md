# [Bun.sh] + Fable Playground

This is a small and experimental repo to add a few bindings for the node.js new competitor runtime [bun.sh]

Although this is not something serious yet, if you actually want to work with me to make this a true bindings project let me know!
I'd be glad to work towards something like that

# Requirements

- .NET6 and above - https://get.dot.net
- Bun - [bun.sh]
