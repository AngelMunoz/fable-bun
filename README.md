# [Bun.sh] + Fable

This is a small repository that adds [Fable] bindings for [Bun.sh] and [Deno]

Fable.Bun which can be found in `src/Fable.Bun` are the bindings to Fable.Bun nothing more, nothing less, these are very minimal and only add a few convenience methods for Bun's request/response impl consumption
